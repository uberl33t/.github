# Organization-wide `.github` Repository

This repository contains **shared GitHub community health files** for all repositories in the [uberl33t](https://github.com/uberl33t) organization.

## Purpose

The `.github` repository is a special repository that allows organizations to **centralize and share files** such as:

- **Issue and Pull Request Templates**
- **CONTRIBUTING Guidelines**
- **CODE_OF_CONDUCT**

These files will automatically apply to all repositories in the organization that do not have their own versions of these files.

## How It Works

- Place your community health files (like `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`, `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, etc.) in the root or `.github/` folder of this repository.
- GitHub will use these files as defaults for all repositories in the organization.
